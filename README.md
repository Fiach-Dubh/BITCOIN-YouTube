3.0 If you want your content to be manually reuploaded to the BITCOIN channel by the admin over a long term basis please feel free to ask. We might do this for some content creators. We also may reach out and invite you to join us with either your own login to the channel, or to have your content reuploaded manually to the channel by the admin over a long/short term or one time basis. 

Channel Function and Thesis:

There's some great Bitcoin content out there, but it's all spread out in the vastness of the internet on different platforms. Unfortunatly, some of the higher signal content can get lost in the noise. This is where the BITCOIN YouTube channel steps in. We want amplify Bitcoin voices that are high quality BITCOIN signal.

All Uploaded Video's Are Automatically Re-uploaded to Rumble and Odyse

Goals:

To make this channel a hands off, merit based, equal opportunity platform for Bitcoin only content creators and educators to use as they see fit, on an open door policy. The PBS of Bitcoin.

Who We Are:

Bitcoin community volunteers and educators.

Strategy:

No one owns the Bitcoin brand. Thus everyone owns the Bitcoin brand.
We hope to invite high quality Bitcoin only developers, voices, creators & producers of Bitcoin content to contribute to the Bitcoin YouTube channel. Ideally you will be able to log in to the channel with your own gmail account as a channel editor, and then upload and publish your content to the channel yourself! Permission-less uploading and publishing!

This can serve to boost your message and spread quality information to the masses under the Bitcoin banner to a wide audience. This project may help if you are trying to build an audience, spread your message, or promote your own YouTube channel, or other social media handles. You can even use the end screen to point to your own YouTube channel and/or video's. The goal though is to always spread relevant quality Bitcoin signal. 

Please don't shill referral links, ads or promotions too heavily though. If you do this too much, or your sponsors & products are questionalbe, we may have to remove your video.

If you want to use the BITCOIN YouTube channel as a way to make short trailer like video's that link to your longer form video's, that's fine. Just don't over do it, and try to make it high signal.

One draw back of this overall project and YouTube in general is the centralized nature of it's design. We acknowledge this is not a decentralized setup. There are centralized choke points to YouTube channel management and participation. But we hope that by aiming for that ideal we will consistently improve towards it and thereby respect the integrity of your work. 

Also, we invite Bitcoin community members to apply to be Channel managers/admins. This way, not all power to delete video's, to add or remove contributors is held by one person. Nominated Channel managers/admins will be vetted more thoroughly and be voted in by community polls on reddit, stacker.news, twitter and YouTube.

Invitation Timeline:

We'll begin by inviting developers, prioritizing those with a history of Bitcoin advocacy. We will then start to invite Bitcoin only educators. After this, other Bitcoin voices may be invited to participate.

Contributor Invitation Requirements:

Strong ethically minded bitcoin only content creators are invited to join. This may also include certain strong Bitcoin only personalities and developers who do not have their own platforms. But anyone can request to be a contributor. Current contributors can also invite others to join. It's generally an open door policy. 

Upload Requirements:

Uploads should be focused on BITCOIN only, and be primarily aimed at educating people. TA, Price, "Crypto", Altcoin discussions are extremely frowned upon. Avoid these topics unless it's recent relevant and Pro Bitcoin, anti Crypto. Talking about altcoins or Crypto in a positive light is highly discouraged and may result in removal of your content.

General commentary on Bitcoin news is fine. 

Video Tutorials, Bitcoin basics, explaining bitcoin technically, bitcoin privacy tools and tutorials, bitcoin history, exploring bitcoin best practices are all welcome and preferred.

Generally the same rules that govern reddit.com/r/bitcoin submissions apply to this project. 

Ideally the shorter the video the better. Clips less than 10 minutes generally do better with current internet audiences these days. Though longer format content may be appropriate from time to time.

Nuance, originality, uniqueness and insight are very much appreciated.

For YouTube Shorts:

Shorts are a newer video category on YouTube. For YouTube to recognize your upload as a short the video needs to be less then 1 minute in length, have the same aspect ratio as a phone (9:16 works). Also be sure to put #Shorts in the video description and/or the title of the video for YouTube to know your video is a short. 

On Sponsors: 

Ideally the fewer the sponsors or Ads in these contributor video's the better, but this may be fine within reason. I understand if you gotta eat. Just don't over do it and please do disclose to youtube that you are including a promotion in the video.

Upload Guidelines:

Please check to make sure you are the only video uploaded for the day on the channel. We want to keep the upload rate to a maximum of once per day, otherwise the audience and YouTube algorithm will get burnt out. It would also be best to wait for another video to be uploaded by a different contributor before you upload a new video of your own. Two or more video's in a row from the same contributor can cause audience fatigue, but may be warranted if the quality is high. 

Be sure to include a catchy thumbnail picture and title. Also make use of cards for including links during the video to resources you mention in the video. End screen buttons to your youtube channel and video's can alos be useful and are encouraged. use the video description for chapters and links to your own social media accounts and other resources.

You may also want to refer to your own YouTube channel in the description of the video you upload using the @<handle> feature. The "@<youryoutubechannelhandle>" can also be included in the video title for even more exposure for your personal channel.

*Benefits of Contributing as a Channel Editor*

Exposure:
Contributors are encouraged to link back to their channels through the end screen icons. they may also modify the video description to do the same. But please do not over shill referral links, ads or promotions.

Access to the Entire Library of BITCOIN Content:

You can use and download any of the past video's uploaded to the channel. but please do not delete or modify any of the video's that are not yours.

Distribution of Content on Social Media Platforms:
  
All video's are auto reuploaded to Rumble and odysee, and often shared on reddit, stacker.news, twitter and other social media platforms by the channel admin and other volunteers. 


Audience Donations: 

A static lightning network QR code can be used by contributors to receive tips from the audience. ZBD.gg is a great wallet for this function or even stacker.news, but please don't over solicit for donations. It can degrade the signal.

Video Editing Collaboration:

Bitcoin experts, developers and other contributors may also want to make an "Issues" request to have their video edited to include animations, graphics or to improve audio, video and/or pacing of the video. Other video editing contributors may then be able to help add these elements to collaboratively build high quality and engaging content. The Channel admin can also help in this area. For chat collaboration among contributors our discord channel is one option: [https://discord.gg/K5H25KZHke](https://discord.gg/K5H25KZHke)

YouTube Monetization, Ads and Sponsors:

Currently the channel is monetized via google ads. But there are no channel sponsors. Content contributers may choose to monetize their content on the channel via google ads by selecting their video in the YouTube studio, clicking the "on" button in the respective moneitization column, clicking "next", review the monetization questionaire (usually you can scroll to the bottom as select "none of the above"), Then click the "submit button" and the video will then run ads and earn ad revenue. By monetizing your video with YouTube ads, you get a boost from the algorithim, resulting in wider viewership. You also may earn some sats for doing so!

At the end of each month, all video revenue will be tallyed by the Channel administrator and distributed via the lightning network in equal part to the origional content creator of the respective video. A revenue share report can also be requested by content contributers.

Live Streaming:

You are welcome to schedule and publish livestreams of events and educational content so long as it follows the high quality standards outlined above. Be sure to reset the livestream key after finishing!

*Checks and Balances*

3 Strike System:

Generally, contributors should not be malicious. Bad faith actors who abuse their powers will be removed. Generally you'll receive a few warnings if you test the boundaries. 

Deletion and Removal Policy:

If you own or are the origional creator of any uploaded content on BITCOIN YouTube and you wish for it to be removed, we will gladly oblige your request to remove the video and/or delete it permenantly from our YouTube studio. Your content, your rules.

Copyright and/or Trademark Ownership:

All rights of uploaded works to the BITCOIN YouTube channel are that of the contributors. We make no claims of ownership on the copyright or trademark of contributed content by contributors to this project. It's their content, they get to decide what happens to it. However, if they use another persons work or abuse another persons rights, the video in question may be removed. Unintentional copyright disputes will be genreally handled by the admin.
