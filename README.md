Channel Function and Thesis:

There's some great Bitcoin content out there, but it's all spread out in the vast spance of the internet on different branded channels. Some of the better content can get lost in the noise. There's also a great deal of noise in the Bitcoin space that is unfortunatly redundent or not really all that helpful. Thus, content curation for the general masses on the Bitcoin story is ideal. This is where the BITCOIN YouTube channel steps in. We sift through all the noise, find the signal and boost that signal to a general audience under the BITCOIN banner. This serves to highlight voices and messages that are high quality BITCOIN signal but often get lost in the noise.

Achievments:

7,752,967 Views

65000 subscribers

700+ Videos

Channel is Verified âœ…

So far we've been tracking the Bitcoin story and evolution through the public conciousness as seen mostly in mainstream news. Though often we promote and cover informative and educational video's that are high quality and recent Bitcoin content. The net result is a cronological video timeline spanning the recent years of Bitcoin's history of mainstream adoption, primarily from a North Americain perspective. Starting with Yellen's "BUY BITCOIN" sign photo bomb moment.

Purpose:

To spread high quality Bitcoin signal.

Goals:

To make this channel a hands off, merit based, equal oppurtunity platform for Bitcoin only content creators and educators. The PBS of Bitcoin.

Who We Are:

Bitcoin community volenteers and educaters. Our main base of operation is reddit.com/r/bitcoin.

Strategy:

No one owns the Bitcoin brand. Thus everyone owns the Bitcoin brand. 

We hope to invite high quality producers of Bitcoin content to contribute to the Bitcoin YouTube channel. Ideally you can log in to the channel with your own gmail account as a channel editor, and then upload and publish your content to the channel yourself! 

This serves to boost your message and spread quality information to the masses under the Bitcoin banner to a wide audience. As it is sometimes difficult for some content to get exposure, this may serve creators well if they are trying to build an audience, spread their message, or promote their own youtube channel, twitter account, or other social media platforms. You can even use the end screen to point to your own youtube channel and/or video's. The goal though is to always spread relevant quality Bitcoin signal. Please don't shill referral links, ads or pormotions. If you do this, we may have to remove your video.

If you just want to use the BITCOIN YouTube channel as a way to make short trailer like video's that link to your longer form video's, that's fine. Just don't over do it, and try to make it high signal.

One draw back of this and YouTube in general is the centralized nature of it's design. We acknowledge this is not a purely decentralized setup. there is a centralized choke points to YouTube channel management and participation. But we hope that by always aiming for that ideal we will consistently improve towards it and respect the integrity of the work contributers to Bitcoin build. We therefore invite Bitcoin community members to apply to be Channel managers/admins. This way not all power to delete video's, to add or remove contributers is held by one person. 

Nominated Channel managers/admins will be vetted more thoroughly and be voted in by community polls on reddit, stacker.news, twitter and youtube.

Structure:

We'll begin by inviting the higher quality producers to contribute, prioritizing those with low youtube channel exposure. Once we have too many contributions, we may branch off to a secondary channel to help focus the content.

Contributer Invitation Requirements:

Ideally only strong ethically minded bitcoin only content creators are invited to join. This may also include certain strong Bitcoin only personalities and developers who do not have their own platforms. The initial round of invitations would be sent out by the administrator, but anyone can request to be acontributer. Current contributers can also invite others to join. It's generally an open door policy, but does require the contributer to understand the purpose and standards of the Channel, and follow it's ideals.

Upload Requirements:

Ideally the shorter the better, Clips less than 10 minutes generally do better with current internet audiences and their attention span these days. Though longer format content may be appropriate if it's quality and bitcoin signal relevance is of the highest quality. Often this in the context of the current cycle with insight beyond what's currently being regergitated by other personalities. nuance, origionality, uniqueness and insight is key. 

On Sponsors: ideally there should not be any paid sponsors in these contributer video's, but this may be negotiable depending on the feedback from contributers. At maximum the sponsorship should only be a visual within the video, and should not be talked about at all by contributers. wasting peoples time shilling for your sponsor is cringe and degrades the signal. 

Upload Guidelines:

Please check to make sure you are the only video upload for the day on the channel. We want to keep the upload rate to a maximum of once per day, otherwise the audience and youtube algorithim will get burnt out. It would also be best to wait for another video to be uploaded by a different contributer before you upload a new video of your own. Two or more video's in a row from the same contributer can also cause audience fatigue, but may be warranted if the quality is high. Feedback on this may be provided by the channel admin

Benefits For Contributers:

Exposure:

contributers are encouraged to link back to their channels through the end screen icons. they may also modify the video description to do the same. please no shilling of referral links, ad or promotions though.

Access to the Entire Library of BITCOIN Content:

you can use and download any of the past video's uploaded to the channel. but please do not delete or modify any of the video's that are not yours, or you will be removed from the project. 

Audience Donations: 
a static lightning network QR code can be used by contributers to recieve donations from the audience. ZBD.gg is a great wallet for this function. Just don't over solicit fo donations, it's cringe. 

Donations to the channels donation links can be tracked using tally.coin for auditability and feedback.

Revenue Sharing:

Currently the channel is not monetized via google ads, and can't be due to google's rules. There are no channel sponsors either.

But if the channel(s) ever gets monetized then a revenue sharing agreement should be in order between the administrator of the Channel and the contributers.
Ideally the contributers should recieve the lion share of the revenue generated. Thus maybe a 1/99 split would be more ideal (99 for content creators/uploaders), or instead of a percentage, the administrator would be paid a fixed rate for their time working to manage the channel and distribute payouts to contributers. this would likely be a manual process relying on YouTube monetiziation analytics. Payouts could be strucutured monthly, with yearly bonus payouts for any revenue generated past the first month of viewership for video's. this may not be relevant at all though, since there's no revenue genreation from this channel currently, and maybe contributers and the community don't want this channel to be monetized. 

Checks and Balances:

3 Strike System:

Many rules govern the channel that have not been written down formally. There are edge cases that can't be covered entirely. But generally, contributers should not be dicks with their shilling or modification of channel content. Bad actors who abuse their powers will be removed. Generally you'll recieve a few warnings if you test the boundaries. Feedback will also be given generally, though not always.

Copyright and/or Trademark Ownership

All rights of uploaded works to the BITCOIN YouTube channel are that of the contributers. We make no claims on the copyright or trademark ownership of contributions by contributers. It's their content, they get to decide what happens to it. If they use someone else's works or abuse someone else's rights, the video in question may be removed.

All video's uploaded by the administrater are for public use in the public domain under fair use.
