Channel Function and Thesis:

There's some great Bitcoin content out there, but it's all spread out in the vast spance of the internet on different branded channels. Some of the better content can get lost in the noise. There's also a great deal of noise in the Bitcoin space that is unfortunatly redundent or not really all that helpful. Thus, content curation for the general masses on the Bitcoin story is ideal. This is where the BITCOIN YouTube channel steps in. We sift through all the noise, find the signal and boost that signal to a general audience under the BITCOIN banner. This serves to highlight voices and messages that are high quality BITCOIN signal but often get lost in the noise.

Achievments

So far we've been tracking the Bitcoin story and evolution through the public conciousness as seen mostly in mainstream news. Though often we promote and cover informative and educational video's that are high quality and recent Bitcoin content. The net result is a cronological video timeline spanning the recent years of Bitcoin's history of mainstream adoption, primarily from a North Americain perspective. Starting with Yellen's "BUY BITCOIN" sign photo bomb moment.

Purpose:

To spread high quality Bitcoin signal.

Goals:

To make this channel the PBS of Bitcoin.

Who We Are:

Bitcoin community volenteers and educaters. Our main base of operations is r/bitcoin.

Strategy:

No one owns the Bitcoin brand. Thus everyone owns the Bitcoin brand?

We hope to invite high quality producers of Bitcoin content to contribute to the Bitcoin YouTube channel. Ideally you can log in to the channel with your own gmail account as a channel editor, and then upload and publisht your content to the channel yourself! 

This serves to boost your message and spread quality information to the masses under the Bitcoin banner. As it is sometimes difficult for some content to get exposure, this may serve creators well if they are trying to build an audience, spread their message, or promote their own youtube channel, twitter account, or other social media platforms. You can even use the end screen to point to your own youtube channel and/or video's. The goal though is to always spread relevant quality Bitcoin signal. But please don't shill referral links or ads. If you do this, we may have to remove your video.

If you just want to use the BITCOIN YouTube channel as a way to make short trailer like video's that link to your longer form video's, that's fine. Just don't over do it, and try to make it high signal.

A draw back of this and YouTube is the centralized nature of this design. We acknowledge this is not a purely decentralized setup. there is a centralized choke points to YouTube channel management and participation. But we hope that by always aiming for that ideal we will consistently improve towards it and respect the integrity of the work contributers to Bitcoin build.

Structure:

We'll begin by inviting the higher quality producers to contribute, prioritizing those with low youtube channel exposure. Once we have too many contributions, we may branch off to a secondary channel to help focus the content.

Contributer Invitation Requirements:

Ideally only strong ethically minded bitcoin only content creators are invited to join. The initial round of invitations would be sent out by the administrator, but anyone can request to be invited to contribute. Current contributers can also invite others to join. It's generally an open door policy, but does require the contributer to understand the purpose and standards of the Channel.

Upload Requirements:

Ideally the shorter the better, Clips less than 10 minutes generally do better with current internet audiences and their attention span these days. Though longer format content may be appropriate if it's quality and bitcoin signal relevance is of the highest quality. Often this in the context of the current cycle with insight beyond what's currently being regergitated by other personalities. nuance, origionality, uniqueness and insight is key. 

On Sponsors: ideally there should not be any paid sponsors in these contributer video's, but this may be negotiable depending on the feedback from contributers. At maximum the sponsorship should only be a visual within the video, and should not be talked about at all by contributers. wasting peoples time shilling for your sponsor is cringe and degrades the signal. 

Benefits For Contributers:

Exposure:

contributers are encouraged to link back to their channels through the end screen icons. they may also modify the video description to do the same. please no shilling of referral links though.

Access to the Entire Library of BITCOIN Content:

you can use and download any of the past video's uploaded to the channel. but please do not delete or modify any of the video's that are not yours, or you will be removed from the project and black balled. 

Audience Donations: 
a static lightning network QR code can be used by contributers to recieve donations from the audience. ZBD.gg is a great wallet for this function. Donations to the channels donation links can be tracked using tally.coin for auditability and feedback. this pot of funds would be custodied by the channel administrater and would be compensation at first for their work maintain the channel. If the channel can self fund through monetization, the donation pot could shift to being a community fund.

Revenue Sharing:

Currently the channel is not monetized via google ads, and can't be due to google's rules.

But if the channel(s) ever gets monetized then a revenue sharing agreement should be in order between the administrator of the Channel and the contributers.
Ideally the contributers should recieve the lion share of the revenue generated. a 50/50 split seems greedy. thus maybe a 10/90 split would be more ideal (90 for content creators/uploaders), or instead of a percentage, the administrator would be paid a fixed rate for their time working to manage the channel and distribute payouts to contributers. this would likely be a manual process relying on YouTube monetiziation analytics. Payouts could be strucutured monthly, with yearly bonus payouts for any revenue generated past the first month of viewership for video's. this may not be relevant at all though, since there's no revenue genreation from this channel yet.

Checks and Balances:

3 Strike System:

Many rules govern the channel that have not been written down formally. There are edge cases that can't be covered entirely. But generally, contributers should not be dicks with their shilling or modification of channel content. Bad actors who abuse their powers will be removed or even blackballed further across the ecosystem. Generally you'll recieve a few warnings if you test the boundaries. Do this enough and you may be removed from being a contributer.

All video's uploaded by the administrater are for public use in the public domain under fair use.
