Achievments

So far we've been tracking the Bitcoin story and evolution through the public conciousness as seen mostly in mainstream news. Though often we promote and cover informative and educational video's that are high quality and recent Bitcoin content. The net result is a cronological video timeline spanning the recent years of Bitcoin's history of mainstream adoption, primarily from a North Americain perspective. Starting with Yellen's Bitcoin-sign photo bomb moment in 2017.

Purpose:

To spread high quality Bitcoin signal.

Goals:

To make this channel the PBS of Bitcoin.

Who We Are:

Bitcoin community volenteers and educaters. Our main base of operations is r/bitcoin.

Strategy:

No one owns the Bitcoin brand. Thus everyone owns the Bitcoin brand?

We hope to invite high quality produsers of Bitcoin content to contribute their creations to being uploaded to the Bitcoin YouTube channel. This serves to boost their message and spread quality information to the masses under the Bitcoin banner. As it is sometimes difficult for some content to get exposure, this may serve creators well if they are trying to build an audience or spread their message. The goal though is to always spread relevant quality Bitcoin signal.

A draw back of this and YouTubr is the centralized nature of this design. We acknowledge this is not a purely decentralized setup, the are centralized choke points to YouTube channel management and participation. But we hope that by always aiming for that ideal we will consistently improve towards it and respect the integrity it inspires.

Structure:

Could start with 2 seperate Bitcoin youtube channels. one for anyone to upload, a free for all so to speak. The other would be the main BITCOIN channel that curates the content more so that people are not bombarded with low signal content.  

Contributer Invitation Requirements:

Ideally only strong ethically minded bitcoin only content creators are invited to join. The initial round of invitations would be sent out by the administrator, but anyone can request to be invited to contribute. Current contributers can also invite others to join. It's generally an open door policy, but does require the contributer to understand the purpose and standards of the Channel.

Upload Requirements:

Ideally the shorter the better, Clips less than 10 minutes generally do better with current internet audiences and their attention span these days. Though longer format content may be appropriate if it's quality and bitcoin signal relevance is of the highest quality. Often this in the context of the current cycle with insight beyond what's currently being regergitated by other personalities. nuance, origionality, uniqueness and insight is key. 

Sponsors: ideally there should not be any paid sponsors in these contributer video's, but this may be negotiable depending on the feedback from contributers. At maximum the sponsorship should only be a visual within the video, and should not be talked about at all by contributers. wasting peoples time shilling for your sponsor is cringe and degrades the signal. 

Benefits For Contributers:

Exposure:

contributers are encouraged to link back to their channels through the end screen icons. they may also modify the video description to do the same. please no shilling of referral links though.

Audience Donations: 
a static lightning network QR code can be used by contributers to recieve donations from the audience. Donations to the channels donation links can be tracked using tally.coin for auditability and feedback. this pot of funds would be custodied by the channel administrater and would be compensation at first for their work maintain the channel. If the channel can self fund through monetization, the donation pot could shift to being a community fund.

Revenue Sharing:

If the channel(s) ever gets monetized then a revenue sharing agreement should be in order between the administrator of the Channel and the contributers.
Ideally the contributers should recieve the lion share of the revenue generated. a 50/50 split seems greedy. thus maybe a 20/80 split would be more ideal (80 for content creators/uploaders), or instead of a percentage, the administrator would be paid a fixed rate for their time working to manage the channel and distribute payouts to contributers. this would likely be a manual process relying on YouTube monetiziation analytics. Payouts could be strucutured monthly, with yearly bonus payouts for any revenue generated past the first month of viewership for video's.


Checks and Balances:

3 Strike System:

Many rules govern the channel that have not been written down formally. There are edge cases that can't be covered entirely. But generally, contributers should not be dicks with their shilling or modification of channel content. Bad actors who abuse their powers will be removed. Generally you'll recieve a few warnings if you test the boundaries. Do this enough and you may be removed from being a contributer. Extreme acts of bad faith will be delt with no mercy.
