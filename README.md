# BITCOIN YouTube
The First Open Source YouTube Channel?

Achievments

So far we've been tracking the Bitcoin story and evolution through the public conciousness as seen mostly in mainstream news. Though often we promote and cover informative and educational video's that are high quality and recent Bitcoin content. The net result is a cronological video timeline spanning the recent years of Bitcoin's history of mainstream adoption. Starting with Yellen's Bitcoin-sign photo bomb moment in 2017.

Purpose

Goals:

To make this channel the PBS of Bitcoin.
