Once you accept this invite, you will have login access to the BITCOIN YouTube Studio. Simply log in to YouTube with your gmail account, and select "switch account" from the drop down menu, and then select "BITCOIN" and you're in! You can then upload, publish or use the account as you see fit. See below for more details.

Channel Function and Thesis:

There's some great Bitcoin content out there, but it's all spread out in the vastness of the internet on different branded channels. Some of the better content can get lost in the noise. There's also a great deal of noise in the Bitcoin space that is unfortunately redundant or not really all that helpful. Thus, content curation for the general masses on the Bitcoin story is ideal. This is where the BITCOIN YouTube channel steps in. We sift through all the noise, find the signal and boost that signal to a general audience under the BITCOIN banner. This serves to highlight voices and messages that are high quality BITCOIN signal but often get lost in the noise.

Achievements:

All Uploaded Video's Are Automatically Re-uploaded to Rumble and Odysee

So far we've been tracking the Bitcoin story and evolution through the public consciousness as seen mostly in mainstream news. Though often we promote and cover informative and educational video's that are high quality and recent Bitcoin content. The net result is a chronological video timeline spanning the recent years of Bitcoin's history, primarily from a North American perspective. Starting with Yellen's "BUY BITCOIN" sign photo bomb moment.

Purpose:

To spread high quality Bitcoin signal.

Goals:

To make this channel a hands off, merit based, equal opportunity platform for Bitcoin only content creators and educators to use as they see fit, on an open door policy. The PBS of Bitcoin.

Who We Are:

Bitcoin community volunteers and educators. Our main base of operation is reddit.com/r/bitcoin.

Strategy:

No one owns the Bitcoin brand. Thus everyone owns the Bitcoin brand.
We hope to invite high quality Bitcoin only developers, voices, creators & producers of Bitcoin content to contribute to the Bitcoin YouTube channel. Ideally you will be able to log in to the channel with your own gmail account as a channel editor, and then upload and publish your content to the channel yourself! Permission-less uploading and publishing!

This can serve to boost your message and spread quality information to the masses under the Bitcoin banner to a wide audience. It can be difficult for some content to get exposure, this project may help if you are trying to build an audience, spread your message, or promote your own YouTube channel, twitter account, or other social media handles. You can even use the end screen to point to your own YouTube channel and/or video's. The goal though is to always spread relevant quality Bitcoin signal. 

Please don't shill referral links, ads or promotions. If you do this, we may have to remove your video.

If you want to use the BITCOIN YouTube channel as a way to make short trailer like video's that link to your longer form video's, that's fine. Just don't over do it, and try to make it high signal.

One draw back of this overall project and YouTube in general is the centralized nature of it's design. We acknowledge this is not a purely decentralized setup. There are centralized choke points to YouTube channel management and participation. But we hope that by aiming for that ideal we will consistently improve towards it and thereby respect the integrity of your work. 

Alos, we invite Bitcoin community members to apply to be Channel managers/admins. This way, not all power to delete video's, to add or remove contributors is held by one person. Nominated Channel managers/admins will be vetted more thoroughly and be voted in by community polls on reddit, stacker.news, twitter and YouTube.

Invitation Timeline:

We'll begin by inviting developers, prioritizing those with a history of Bitcoin advocacy. We will then start to invite Bitcoin only educators. After this, other Bitcoin voices may be invited to participate. If we end up having too many contributions we may create a secondary channel to help focus the content.

Contributor Invitation Requirements:

Ideally only strong ethically minded bitcoin only content creators are invited to join. This may also include certain strong Bitcoin only personalities and developers who do not have their own platforms. The initial round of invitations would be sent out by the administrator, but anyone can request to be a contributor. Current contributors can also invite others to join. It's generally an open door policy, but does require the contributor to understand the purpose and standards of the Channel, and follow it's ideals. To apply to be a contributor, simply open up an issue in "Issues", or contact the channel admin.

Upload Requirements:

Uploads should be focused on BITCOIN only, and be primarily aimed at educating people. TA, Price, and Macro content is generally already covered, and is often redundant, if not misleading. Try to avoid these topics unless it's recent and relevant. "News" segments are also already mostly covered, but they may be useful to the audience if they are high signal. 

General commentary on Bitcoin news is often mid to low signal, but this often depends on the news being covered. The more toxic you are, the better, and launching into educational Bitcoin best practise from a news item as a launch point is also welcome.

Video Tutorials, Bitcoin basics, explaining bitcoin technically, bitcoin privacy tools and tutorial, bitcoin history, exploring bitcoin best practises are all welcome and preferred.

Generally the same rules that govern reddit.com/r/bitcoin submissions apply to this YouTube: 

"Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. This subreddit is exclusive to Bitcoin.
Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.
No referral links in submissions.
No compilations of free Bitcoin sites.
Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like "Buying 100 BTC" or "Selling my computer for bitcoins" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion.
Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system.
Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to.
Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation."


Ideally the shorter the video the better. Clips less than 10 minutes generally do better with current internet audiences these days. Though longer format content may be appropriate if it's quality and bitcoin signal relevance is high quality. 

Nuance, originality, uniqueness and insight are very much appreciated.

For YouTube Shorts:

Shorts are a newer video category on YouTube. For YouTube to recognize your upload as a short the video needs to be less then 1 minute in length, have the same aspect ratio as a phone (9:16 works). Also be sure to put #Shorts in the video description and/or the title of the video for YouTube to know your video is a short. 

On Sponsors: 

Ideally there should be no sponsors or Ads in these contributor video's, but this may be negotiable depending on the feedback from contributors. At maximum sponsorships should only be a visual within the video, and should not be talked about at all by contributors. wasting peoples time shilling for your sponsor degrades the signal.

Upload Guidelines:

Please check to make sure you are the only video upload for the day on the channel. We want to keep the upload rate to a maximum of once per day, otherwise the audience and YouTube algorithm will get burnt out. It would also be best to wait for another video to be uploaded by a different contributor before you upload a new video of your own. Two or more video's in a row from the same contributor can cause audience fatigue, but may be warranted if the quality is high. 

Feedback on this and other details may be provided by the channel admin.

You may also want to refer to your own YouTube channel in the description of the video you upload using the @<handle> feature. This "@<youryoutubechannelhandle>" can also be included in the video title for even more exposure for your channel.

Commenting Guidelines:

If you decide to comment anywhere on YouTube using the BITCOIN account, please be sure to begin each message with "@<YOURCHANNELNAME> Speaking:" so people know who is speaking. If you don't have an channel name to @ with, then please just use your nym or name at the beginning of your message "<name> Speaking:"

*Benefits of Contributing as a Channel Editor*

Exposure:
Contributors are encouraged to link back to their channels through the end screen icons. they may also modify the video description to do the same. But please no shilling of referral links, ads or promotions.

Access to the Entire Library of BITCOIN Content:

You can use and download any of the past video's uploaded to the channel. but please do not delete or modify any of the video's that are not yours.

Distribution of Content on Social Media Platforms:
  
All video's are auto reuploaded to Rumble and odysee, and often shared on reddit, stacker.news, twitter and other social media platforms by the channel admin and other volenteers. 


Audience Donations: 

a static lightning network QR code can be used by contributors to receive donations from the audience. ZBD.gg is a great wallet for this function. Just don't over solicit for donations. it can degrade the signal.

Any general donations to the channel will be tracked using tally.coin for audit-ability and feedback: https://tallycoin.app/@bitcoinallcaps/bitcoin-youtube-tip-page-av5s8l/

Funds raised will be used to cover channel expenses, and to issue grants to contributors who need to purchase hardware such as mics, cameras or video editing software. Priority for these grants will be given to developers first.

Video Editing Collaboration:

Bitcoin experts, developers and other contributors may also want to make an "Issues" request to have their video edited to include animations, graphics or to improve audio, video and/or pacing of the video. Other video editing contributors may then be able to help add these elements to collaboratively build high quality and engaging content. The Channel admin can also help in this area. For chat collaboration among contributors our discord channel is one option: https://discord.gg/TyhPhH4Mpq

Revenue Sharing:

Currently the channel is not monetized via google ads. There are no channel sponsors either.
But if the channel ever gets monetized then a revenue sharing agreement could be in order between the administrator of the Channel and the contributors. Ideally the contributors should receive the lion share of the revenue generated. Thus maybe a 1/99 split would be ideal (99 for content creators/up-loaders), or instead of a percentage, the administrator would be paid a fixed rate for their time working to manage the channel and distribute payments to contributors using Bitcoin. this would likely be a manual process relying on YouTube monetization numbers. Payouts could be structured monthly, with yearly bonus payouts for any revenue generated past the first month of video viewership. this may not be relevant at all though, since there's no revenue generation from this channel currently, and maybe contributors and the community do not want this channel to be monetized.

Live Streaming:

You are welcome to schedule and publish livestreams of events and educational content so long as it follows the high quality standards outlined above. Be sure to reset the livestream key after finishing!

Commenting Ability:

You can use the BITCOIN account to comment inside livestream chats, on other video's and generally all around YouTube. Please do not abuse this feature though and be sure to include your identifying handle with commenting (instructions above).

*Checks and Balances*

3 Strike System:

Many rules govern the channel that have not been written down formally. There are edge cases that can't be covered entirely. But generally, contributors should not be malicious or ignorant with their shilling or modification of channel content. Bad actors who abuse their powers will be removed. Generally you'll receive a few warnings if you test the boundaries. Feedback will also be given generally, though not always.

Copyright and/or Trademark Ownership:

All rights of uploaded works to the BITCOIN YouTube channel are that of the contributors. We make no claims on the copyright or trademark ownership of contributions by contributors. It's their content, they get to decide what happens to it. However, if they use another persons work or abuse their rights, the video in question may be removed. Unintentional copyright disputes will be genreally handled by the admin.

Genreally, video's uploaded by the administrator are in the public domain under fair use.

Process For Uploading Video's to BITCOIN YouTube if You Don't Have a Contributor/Editor Gmail Account:

If you don't wish to obtain a gmail account to login to the channel yourself, or just want to do a one time upload of your content, please feel free to submit an Issue, using the "Issues" tab on this GitHub page. Include a link to your content and desired parameters for upload and it will be reuploaded by the channel admin manually. You can also contact the admin of the channel via twitter, email or reddit with the same details. The content will then be re-uploaded to the channel by the admin, once it's been checked for the above mentioned quality standards.
