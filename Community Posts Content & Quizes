Q: Where is the best place to Hodl your Bitcoin?

A: On my phone.
B: In cold storage on an offline Bitcoin-Only hardware wallet accessible via airgap.
C: With Conbase so I can get my account drained by hackers and phone scammers
D: With Blackrock in an ETF so they can print more Bitcoin paper IOU's

Answer: B
Explanation
"hodling" your bitcoin on a exchange, ETF, or stock (MSTR) is not Bitcoin. These are paper IOU's that can rug pull you at anytime. 
Furthermore, they use your Bitcoin to pump scam tokens, trade against retail, and attack the Bitcoin network. 
In Bitcoin, possession is 10/10th the law: FTX, MTGOX, Quadriga. 
Protect yourself & Bitcoin by hodling your own keys offline with a Bitcoin-only hardware wallet. 
An airgap enables you to transact Bitcoin entirely offline with no connection to the internet.
